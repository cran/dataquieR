# dataquieR 1.0.4
  * Fixed CITATION, a broken reference in Rd and a problem with the vignette
    on `pandoc`-less systems
  * Improved an inaccurate argument description for multivariate outliers
  * Fixed a problem with error messages, if a `dataquieR` function was called 
    by a generated function `f` that lives in an environment 
    directly inheriting from the empty environment, e.g. 
    `environment(f) <- new.env(parent = emptyenv())`.
  * Marked some examples as `dontrun`, because they sometimes caused `NOTE`s
    on `rhub`.

# dataquieR 1.0.3
  * Addressed all comments by the CRAN reviewers, thank you.

# dataquieR 1.0.2
  * Bug Fix: If an empty data frame was delivered in the `SummaryTable` entry 
    of a result within a `dq_report` output, the `summary` and also 
    `print` generic did not work on the report.
  
# dataquieR 1.0.1
  * Skipping some of the slower tests on CRAN now. On my local system,
   a full `devtools::check(cran = TRUE, env_vars = c(NOT_CRAN = "false"))`
   takes 2:22 minutes now.
  
# dataquieR (1.0.0)
  * Initial CRAN release candidate
